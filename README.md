# README Generator

  ## Description
  I have developed a quick and easy README generator that works through user input through the command line answering a few questions and generating a formatted README markdown file.

  ## Installation
  After you have copied or cloned this repository, your next step will be to ignore this README.md in the file branch (or even delete it if you'd like) and install node.js if you do not already have that downloaded on your computer (here is the link to download: https://nodejs.org/en/). You now want to make sure you are in the development branch of the project. Once in the develop branch go ahead and use the terminal you are most comfortable with and enter `node index.js` answer the questions and press enter after each answer and voila! You now have an easily generated and already formatted README.md ready to go for your project.

  ## Usage
  This project is used to simply answer questions through the terminal to generate a README file for any project formatting the answers in a markdown file for the user.
